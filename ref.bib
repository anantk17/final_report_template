abstract="Operating system data provenance has a range of applications, such as security monitoring, debugging heterogeneous runtime environments, and profiling complex applications. However, fine-grained collection of provenance over extended periods of time can result in large amounts of metadata. Xie et al. describe an algorithm that leverages the subgraph similarity and locality of reference in provenance graphs to perform batch compression. We build on their effort to construct an online version that can perform streaming compression in SPADE. Our optimizations provide both performance and compression improvements over their baseline.",

abstract="SPADE is an open source software infrastructure for data provenance collection and management. The underlying data model used throughout the system is graph-based, consisting of vertices and directed edges that are modeled after the node and relationship types described in the Open Provenance Model. The system has been designed to decouple the collection, storage, and querying of provenance metadata. At its core is a novel provenance kernel that mediates between the producers and consumers of provenance information, and handles the persistent storage of records. It operates as a service, peering with remote instances to enable distributed provenance queries. The provenance kernel on each host handles the buffering, filtering, and multiplexing of incoming metadata from multiple sources, including the operating system, applications, and manual curation. Provenance elements can be located locally with queries that use wildcard, fuzzy, proximity, range, and Boolean operators. Ancestor and descendant queries are transparently propagated across hosts until a terminating expression is satisfied, while distributed path queries are accelerated with provenance sketches.",
