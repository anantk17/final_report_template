However, fine-grained collection of provenance over extended periods of time can result in large amounts of metadata. Xie et al. describe an algorithm that leverages the subgraph similarity and locality of reference in provenance graphs to perform batch compression. We build on their effort to construct an online version that can perform streaming compression in SPADE. Our optimizations provide both performance and compression improvements over their baseline.},

		  that provenance could be used in the creation of
		  accountable systems helping users to answer questions
		  related to the processing of information. Provenance
		  consists of causal dependencies between data and events
		  explaining what contributed to a result in a specific

		  becomes transparent since the provenance of data can be
		  analysed against usage rules to decide whether processing

		  reliable event logging system is an essential component of
		  smart homes with a wide range of applications such as fault
		  detection, forensics and accounting. Existing smart home
		  {IoT} frameworks are cloud-based and privacy of
		  fine-grained log data is a real concern. In this paper we
		  propose a host-based conceptual framework for storing and
		  processing data in smart homes, analyze security
		  requirements of such environments and design a forward
		  secure event logging system that satisfies these
		  environments. We give an overview of our implementation of
		  a message (event) logging system for a typical home, and
		  present efficiency evaluation of our cryptographic

  abstract      = {The results of botnet detection methods are usually presented without any comparison. Although it is generally accepted that more comparisons with third-party methods may help to improve the area, few papers could do it. Among the factors that prevent a comparison are the difficulties to share a dataset, the lack of a good dataset, the absence of a proper description of the methods and the lack of a comparison methodology. This paper compares the output of three different botnet detection methods by executing them over a new, real, labeled and large botnet dataset. This dataset includes botnet, normal and background traffic. The results of our two methods (BClus and CAMNEP) and BotHunter were compared using a methodology and a novel error metric designed for botnet detections methods. We conclude that comparing methods indeed helps to better estimate how good the methods are, to improve the algorithms, to build better datasets and to build a comparison methodology.},

  abstract      = {The advantage of collecting data provenance information has driven research on how to extend or modify applications and systems in order to provide it, or the creation of architectures that are built from the ground up with provenance capabilities. In this paper we propose a universal data provenance framework, using dynamic instrumentation, which gathers data provenance information for real-world applications without any code modifications. Our framework simplifies the task of finding the right points to instrument, which can be cumbersome in large and complex systems. We have built a proof-of-concept implementation of the framework on top of DTrace. Moreover, we evaluated its functionality by using it for three different scenarios: file-system operations, database transactions and web browser HTTP requests. Based on our experiences we believe that it is possible to provide data provenance, transparently, to any layer of the software stack.},

  abstract      = {As nuclear power expands, technical, economic, political, and environmental analyses of nuclear fuel cycles by simulators increase in importance. To date, however, current tools are often fleet-based rather than discrete and restrictively licensed rather than open source. Each of these choices presents a challenge to modeling fidelity, generality, efficiency, robustness, and scientific transparency. The Cyclus nuclear fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem incorporate modern insights from simulation science and software architecture to solve these problems so that challenges in nuclear fuel cycle analysis can be better addressed. A summary of the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem are presented. Additionally, the implementation of each is discussed in the context of motivating challenges in nuclear fuel cycle simulation. Finally, the current capabilities of Cyclus are demonstrated for both open and closed fuel cycles.},

  abstract      = {A recent escalation of application layer Denial of Service (DoS) attacks on the Internet has quickly shifted the interest of the research community traditionally focused on network-based DoS attacks. A number of studies came forward showing the potency of attacks, introducing new varieties and discussing potential detection strategies. The underlying problem that triggered all this research is the stealthiness of application layer DoS attacks. Since they usually do not manifest themselves at the network level, these types of attacks commonly avoid traditional network-layer based detection mechanisms. In this work we turn our attention to this problem and present a novel detection approach for application layer DoS attacks based on nonparametric CUSUM algorithm. We explore the effectiveness of our detection on various types of these attacks in the context of modern web servers. Since in production environments detection is commonly performed on a sampled subset of network traffic, we also study the impact of sampling techniques on detection of application layer DoS attack. Our results demonstrate that the majority of sampling techniques developed specifically for intrusion detection domain introduce significant distortion in the traffic that minimizes a detection algorithm's ability to capture the traces of these stealthy attacks.},

  abstract      = {Host-based Anomaly Detection Systems (ADSs) monitor for significant deviations from normal software behavior. Several techniques have been investigated for detecting anomalies in system call sequences. Among these, Sequence Time-Delay Embedding (STIDE), Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) have shown a high level of anomaly detection accuracy. Although ADSs can detect novel attacks, they generate a large number of false alarms due to the difficulty in obtaining complete descriptions of normal software behavior. This paper presents a multiple-detector ADS that efficiently combines the decisions from heterogeneous detectors (e.g., STIDE, HMM, and OCSVM), using Boolean combination in the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) space, to reduce the false alarms. Results on two modern and large system call datasets generated from Linux and Windows operating systems show that the proposed ADS consistently outperforms an ADS based on a single best detector and on an ensemble of homogeneous detectors. At an operating point of zero percent alarm rate, the proposed multiple-detector ADS increased the true positive rate by 500% on the Linux dataset and by 25% on the Window dataset. Furthermore, the combinations of decisions from multiple heterogeneous detectors make the ADS more reliable and resilient against evasion and adversarial attacks.},

  abstract      = {Electronic documents are widely used to store and share information such as bank statements, contracts, articles, maps and tax information. Many different applications exist for displaying a given electronic document, and users rightfully assume that documents will be rendered similarly independently of the application used. However, this is not always the case, and these inconsistencies, regardless of their causes---bugs in the application or the file itself---can become critical sources of miscommunication. In this paper, we present a study on the correctness of PDF documents and readers. We start by manually investigating a large number of real-world PDF documents to understand the frequency and characteristics of cross-reader inconsistencies, and find that such inconsistencies are common---13.5{\%} PDF files are inconsistently rendered by at least one popular reader. We then propose an approach to detect and localize the source of such inconsistencies automatically. We evaluate our automatic approach on a large corpus of over 230 K documents using 11 popular readers and our experiments have detected 30 unique bugs in these readers and files. We also reported 33 bugs, some of which have already been confirmed or fixed by developers.},

  abstract      = {Kernel audit logs are an invaluable source of information in the forensic investigation of a cyber-attack. However, the coarse granularity of dependency information in audit logs leads to the construction of huge attack graphs which contain false or inaccurate dependencies. To overcome this problem, we propose a system, called ProPatrol, which leverages the open compartmentalized design in families of enterprise applications used in security-sensitive contexts (e.g., browser, chat client, email client). To achieve its goal, ProPatrol infers a model for an application's high-level tasks as input-processing compartments using purely the audit log events generated by that application. The main benefit of this approach is that it does not rely on source code or binary instrumentation, but only on a preliminary and general knowledge of an application's architecture to bootstrap the analysis. Our experiments with enterprise-level attacks demonstrate that ProPatrol significantly cuts down the forensic investigation effort and quickly pinpoints the root-cause of attacks. ProPatrol incurs less than 2{\%} runtime overhead on a commodity operating system.},

  abstract      = {The evaluation of algorithms and techniques to implement intrusion detection systems heavily rely on the existence of well designed datasets. In the last years, a lot of efforts have been done toward building these datasets. Yet, there is still room to improve. In this paper, a comprehensive review of existing datasets is first done, making emphasis on their main shortcomings. Then, we present a new dataset that is built with real traffic and up-to-date attacks. The main advantage of this dataset over previous ones is its usefulness for evaluating IDSs that consider long-term evolution and traffic periodicity. Models that consider differences in daytime/nighttime or weekdays/weekends can also be trained and evaluated with it. We discuss all the requirements for a modern IDS evaluation dataset and analyze how the one presented here meets the different needs.},

		  entails the nature of invocations that took place,
		  how/where the data were created, modified, updated and the
		  user's engagement with the service. With such an
		  encyclopedia of information, it opens up a diversity of
		  value-added features (compliance control, accountability)
		  that can improve the usability of a service.
		  
		  In this paper, we extend our previous work on the
		  provenance-based policy language (cProvl) and model (cProv)
		  by proposing a preliminary policy control framework. The
		  framework provides the necessary building blocks for
		  integrating and developing services that are able to
		  generate and use provenance data for provenance-based
		  compliance control, which runs on a XACML engine. We
		  demonstrate the capability of the framework by applying it
		  to a service case, and conduct benchmarks to determine its
		  scalability and performance.},

		  Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) such as OpenStack can
		  enhance the access control capabilities of cloud systems.
		  Toward this purpose, we introduce tenant-awareness to the
		  PBAC C [14] model by capturing tenant as contextual
		  information in the attribute provenance data. Built on this
		  model, we present a cloud service architecture that
		  provides PBAC authorization service and management. We
		  discuss in depth the variations of PBAC authorization
		  deployment architecture within the OpenStack platform and
		  implement a proof-of-concept prototype. We analyze the
		  initial experimental results and discuss approaches for

  abstract      = {Antivirus software is one of the most widely used tools for detecting and stopping malicious and unwanted files. However, the long term effectiveness of traditional host-based antivirus is questionable. Antivirus software fails to detect many modern threats and its increasing complexity has resulted in vulnerabilities that are being exploited by malware. This paper advocates a new model for malware detection on end hosts based on providing antivirus as an in-cloud network service. This model enables identification of malicious and unwanted software by multiple, heterogeneous detection engines in parallel, a technique we term 'N-version protection'. This approach provides several important benefits including better detection of malicious software, enhanced forensics capabilities, retrospective detection, and improved deployability and management. To explore this idea we construct and deploy a production quality in-cloud antivirus system called CloudAV. CloudAV includes a lightweight, cross-platform host agent and a network service with ten antivirus engines and two behavioral detection engines. We evaluate the performance, scalability, and efficacy of the system using data from a real-world deployment lasting more than six months and a database of 7220 malware samples covering a one year period. Using this dataset we find that CloudAV provides 35% better detection coverage against recent threats compared to a single antivirus engine and a 98% detection rate across the full dataset. We show that the average length of time to detect new threats by an antivirus engine is 48 days and that retrospective detection can greatly minimize the impact of this delay. Finally, we relate two case studies demonstrating how the forensics capabilities of CloudAV were used by operators during the deployment.},

  abstract  = {Advanced cyber attacks consist of multiple stages aimed at being stealthy and elusive. Such attack patterns leave their footprints spatio-temporally dispersed across many different logs in victim machines. However, existing log-mining intrusion analysis systems typically target only a single type of log to discover evidence of an attack and therefore fail to exploit fundamental inter-log connections. The output of such single-log analysis can hardly reveal the complete attack story for complex, multi-stage attacks. Additionally, some existing approaches require heavyweight system instrumentation, which makes them impractical to deploy in real production environments. To address these problems, we present HERCULE, an automated multi-stage log-based intrusion analysis system. Inspired by graph analytics research in social network analysis, we model multi-stage intrusion analysis as a community discovery problem. HERCULE builds multi-dimensional weighted graphs by correlating log entries across multiple lightweight logs that are readily available on commodity systems. From these, HERCULE discovers any "attack communities" embedded within the graphs. Our evaluation with 15 well known APT attack families demonstrates that HERCULE can reconstruct attack behaviors from a spectrum of cyber attacks that involve multiple stages with high accuracy and low false positive rates.},

The key idea is to use a test environment and emulate realistic user behaviour with parameterised scripts on the clients. Comprehensive logging mechanisms provide additional information which may be used for a better understanding of the inner dynamics of an IDS. Finally, the proposed approach is used to generate the flow-based CIDDS-002 data set.},

This work provides a focused literature survey of data sets for network-based intrusion detection and describes the underlying packet- and flow-based network data in detail. The paper identifies 15 different properties to assess the suitability of individual data sets for specific evaluation scenarios. These properties cover a wide range of criteria and are grouped into five categories such as data volume or recording environment for offering a structured search. Based on these properties, a comprehensive overview of existing data sets is given. This overview also highlights the peculiarities of each data set. Furthermore, this work briefly touches upon other sources for network-based data such as traffic generators and data repositories. Finally, we discuss our observations and provide some recommendations for the use and the creation of network-based data sets.},

  abstract      = {Cross-browser (and cross-platform) issues are prevalent in modern web based applications and range from minor cosmetic bugs to critical functional failures. In spite of the relevance of these issues, cross-browser testing of web applications is still a fairly immature field. Existing tools and techniques require a considerable manual effort to identify such issues and provide limited support to developers for fixing the underlying cause of the issues. To address these limitations, we propose a technique for automatically detecting cross-browser issues and assisting their diagnosis. Our approach is dynamic and is based on differential testing. It compares the behavior of a web application in different web browsers, identifies differences in behavior as potential issues, and reports them to the developers. Given a page to be analyzed, the comparison is performed by combining a structural analysis of the information in the page's DOM and a visual analysis of the page's appearance, obtained through screen captures. To evaluate the usefulness of our approach, we implemented our technique in a tool, called WEBDIFF, and used WEBDIFF to identify cross-browser issues in nine real web applications. The results of our evaluation are promising, in that WEBDIFF was able to automatically identify 121 issues in the applications, while generating only 21 false positives. Moreover, many of these false positives are due to limitations in the current implementation of WEBDIFF and could be eliminated with suitable engineering.},

  abstract      = {Several alert correlation approaches have been proposed to
		  date to reduce the number of non-relevant alerts and false
		  positives typically generated by Intrusion Detection
		  Systems (IDS). Inspired by the mental process of the
		  contextualisation used by security analysts to weed out
		  less relevant alerts, some of these approaches have tried
		  to incorporate contextual information such as: type of
		  systems, applications, users, and networks into the
		  correlation process. However, these approaches are not
		  flexible as they only perform correlation based on the
		  narrowly defined contexts. information resources available
		  to the security analysts while preserving the maximum
		  flexibility and the power of abstraction in both the
		  definition and the usage of such concepts, we propose
		  ONTIDS, a context-aware and ontology-based alert
		  correlation framework that uses ontologies to represent and
		  store the alerts information, alerts context, vulnerability
		  information, and the attack scenarios. ONTIDS employs
		  simple ontology logic rules written in Semantic
		  Query-enhance Web Rule Language (SQWRL) to correlate and
		  filter out non-relevant alerts. We illustrate the potential
		  usefulness and the flexibility of ONTIDS by employing its
		  reference implementation on two separate case studies,
		  inspired from the DARPA 2000 and UNB ISCX IDS evaluation
		  datasets.},

  abstract      = {Over the past decade many anomaly-detection techniques have been proposed and/or deployed to provide early warnings of cyber-attacks, particularly of those attacks involving masqueraders and novel methods. To date, however, there appears to be no study which has identified a systematic method that could be used by an attacker to undermine an anomaly-based intrusion detection system. This paper shows how an adversary can craft an offensive mechanism that renders an anomaly-based intrusion detector blind to the presence of on-going, common attacks. It presents a method that identifies the weaknesses of an anomaly-based intrusion detector, and shows how an attacker can manipulate common attacks to exploit those weaknesses. The paper explores the implications of this threat, and suggests possible improvements for existing and future anomaly-based intrusion detection systems.},

  abstract      = {A masquerader is an (often external) attacker who, after succeeding in obtaining a legitimate user's credentials, attempts to use the stolen identity to carry out malicious actions. Automatic detection of masquerading attacks is generally undertaken by approaching the problem from an anomaly detection perspective: a model of normal behaviour for each user is constructed and significant departures from it are identified as potential masquerading attempts. One potential vulnerability of these schemes lies in the fact that anomaly detection algorithms are generally susceptible to deception. In this work, we first investigate how a resourceful masquerader can successfully evade detection while still accomplishing his goals. For this, we introduce the concept of masquerade mimicry attacks, consisting of carefully constructed attacks that are not identified as anomalous. We then explore two different detection schemes to thwart such attacks. We first study the introduction of a blind randomisation strategy into a baseline anomaly detector. We then propose a more accurate algorithm, called Probabilistic Padding Identification (PPI) and based on the Kullback--Leibler divergence, which attempts to identify if a sufficiently anomalous attack is present within an apparently normal behavioural pattern. Our experimental results indicate that the PPI algorithm achieves considerably better detection quality than both blind randomised strategies and adversarial-unaware approaches.},

  abstract      = {Provenance of system subjects (e.g., processes) and objects (e.g., files) are very useful for many forensics tasks. In our analysis and comparison of existing Linux provenance tracing systems, we found that most systems assume the Linux kernel to be in the trust base, making these systems vulnerable to kernel level malware. To address this problem, we present HProve, a hypervisor level provenance tracing system to reconstruct kernel malware attack story. It monitors the execution of kernel functions and sensitive objects, and correlates the system subjects and objects to form the causality dependencies for the attacks. We evaluated our prototype on 12 real world kernel malware samples, and the results show that it can correctly identify the provenance behaviors of the kernel malware.},

  abstract      = {Audit trail patterns generated on behalf of a Unix process can be used to model the process behavior. Most of the approaches proposed so far use a table of fixed-length patterns to represent the process model. However, variable-length patterns seem to be more naturally suited to model the process behavior, but they are also more difficult to construct. In this paper, we present a novel technique to build a table of variable-length patterns. This technique is based on Teiresias, an algorithm initially developed for discovering rigid patterns in unaligned biological sequences. We evaluate the quality of our technique in a testbed environment, and compare it with the intrusion-detection system proposed by Forrest et al. [8], which is based on fixed-length patterns. The results achieved with our novel method are significantly better than those obtained with the original method based on fixed-length patterns.},
